Subject: [PATCH v3 0/1] Offset correction for apds9960

Hello,
This patch adds support for doing internal offset correction for the
proximity and gesture circuits. The correction value is written to
the respective POFFSET_x or GOFFSET_x register depending on which
direction we want to perform this calibration.
For the proximity channel we apply the offset to both the DL and UR
directions. And for the gesture channel we apply the offset to the
respective U, D, L, R direction.

Changes in v3:
- Some code refactoring based on comments in v2
- Link to v2 : https://lore.kernel.org/linux-iio/20240803145836.4e372899@jic23-huawei/T/#u

Changes in v2:
- Used IIO_CHAN_INFO_CALIBBIAS instead of exposing custom sysfs attributes
- Used enum to choose between correct the offset registers
- Corrected the formatting and style errors
- Link to v1 : https://lore.kernel.org/linux-iio/20240707171357.709d9e35@jic23-huawei/
